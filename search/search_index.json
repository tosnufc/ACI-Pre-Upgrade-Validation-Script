This information is required from both leaf switches and hypervisors to dynamically detect the leaf interface connecting to the hypervisor, even when there is an intermediate switch in between such as Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect.

When a border leaf switch comes online with a new version, it will bring up routing peers. After this, when it starts to exchange information about routing prefixes, frames may need to carry a huge payload containing lots of prefixes. Based on the size of the table, the update may need a larger frame size which might not reach the other side. The size of this payload will depend upon local MTU.

The former is to source the BGP session from a loopback while the latter is to source the BGP session from each interface.</p> <p>Prior to release 4.1(2), when a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile is configured at a node profile without configuring a loopback, Cisco APIC uses another available IP address on the same border leaf switch in the same VRF as the BGP source, such as a loopback IP address from another L3Out or an IP address configured for each interface. This has a risk of the BGP source IP address being changed unintentionally across reboots or upgrades. This behavior has been changed based on CSCvm28482 and ACI no longer establishes a BGP session through a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile at a node profile when a loopback is not configured in the node profile. Instead, a fault F3488 is raised in these situations. This fault cannot be used as a pre-upgrade check because it is raised only after an upgrade.</p> <p>Due to this change, when upgrading from an older version to release 4.1(2) or later, a BGP session is no longer established if the session was generated via a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile under a node profile and a loopback is not configured in the node profile.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>When multiple interfaces in the same node profile need to establish a BGP peer with the same peer IP, you might attempt to configure a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile at a node profile without a loopback so that the same BGP Peer configuration is applied, as a fallback due to the missing loopback, to each interface in the same node profile. This is because a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile with the same peer IP address could not be configured at multiple interface profiles within the same node profile. This limitation was loosened based on CSCvw88636 on 4.2(7f).
